# Risk

Tag the project as “final”
Increase the line coverage of the test cases to at least 80%
Refactor, refactor, refactor: Ask yourself: can you implement classes with fewer fields? Can the number of method arguments be smaller? Have you designed any Exception specific to your project (e.g. InvalidMoveExeption)?
